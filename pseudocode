    <!--Add a huge heading with inspirational people at the top and each picture should
        move to the next inspirational person of your choice.

        Below it should have a navigation link with the links HOME-TRIVIA-ABOUT/ME.

        The left section should have resources such as Prince Pa, Trent Shelton and that
        british indian guy I cant remember his name. For inspirational references.

        In the middle should be automatic movement of pictures of inspirational people.
        this should move on it's on, so lok for a corousel and things of other links to
        make this happen.

    Think of some other things you can use as icons for the bottom footer.
