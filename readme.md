# Trivia

I did a simple  trivia quiz that consists of five questions where you have to 
answer by typing into the input your answer. 

# JavaScript


* Created 3 global variables called
    1.  score - setting the score to 0
    2. quesContainer - grabbed the class of ques from the mark up languange
    3.  button - created an id of start in the html for the click here feature
* Created a function called trivia which consists of  2 variables with arrays of strings.

* Within the DOM I added an input to input the answers. 
    1. Created a variable called appending
    2. used the setAttribute to create a class of button
    3. Appending the arrays in the container div to show up in the browser
I also need to practice more because this is where I needed help the most

* Created 5 functions called checkAnswers 1-5
    1. Within each function, I created if/else statements
    2. Had many bugs and errors, found out I had to use input.value for each string.
    3. Created 5 event listeners to check through each function

# HTML

* I created minimal HTML and utilized most of my time learning javascript with the help
of another peer. I only created a header, button and 5 divs.

# CSS
 * I used the body to set a background image which is fixed to the page
 * I styled the buttons and the divs
