# Trivia

I did a simple  trivia quiz that conducts of five questions where you have to 
answer by typing into the input your answer. 

#JavaScript
* Used JS for a lot of HTML embedding
    1. Created 4 divs in the HTML with the class of ques.
    2. Did minimal hyper text markup 
* I created a function with 2 variables that conists of arrays/strings that
will embed into the web browser.
* Created a for loop that will loop through each array
* Created a function called checkAnswers 1,2 and 3. I had to use input/array plus the value
to get it to work properly.
* Added an EventListener to each checkAnswer function to make sure each one is clicked
* The submit button is the pink button next to the input value.
